# bma_of_nuclear_mass_models

This is an attempt to produce a simple and readable implementation of Bayesian model averaging (BMA).
Instead of writing multiple methods the goal is to make it more clear by using a class method.
It is a hobby project and might never be fully realised. But it is based on messy but working code
that implemented BMA in the study of nuclear mass models for my Master thesis. The idea is that
a class method may more easily be made modular, i.e. methods can be swapped without much rewriting.
